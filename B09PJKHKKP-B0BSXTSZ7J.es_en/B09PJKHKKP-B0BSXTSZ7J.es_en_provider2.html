The children know, of course they know. I wouldn't even be surprised if Jorge was aware of all our online escapades. He's a computer genius. We must have left clues. I'd die of shame, with what moral authority could I look them in the eye?</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-271">"Always worried about what others will say."</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-272">"I know, grandpa. I know, don't tell me again."</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-273">The first time I discovered my wife's chats with another man, I flew into a rage. I screamed at her with all the anger in my soul, I spat at her, I was almost on the verge of hitting her. It only lasted a moment, until she fixed her dark eyes on me and denied everything with that cold lawyer's logic. I chose to believe her despite the evidence. I took refuge in a fantasy to maintain a facade that we both use as a masquerade. I don't ask, and she feigns calculated cordiality. Then I decided to try it myself. To delve into that unknown world to investigate what she's trying to find in it.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-274">"A frustrating experience, wasn't it?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-275">"Maybe I'm not ready or I don't know what I'm looking for."</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-276">"You didn't last long either, you deactivated your account in three weeks."</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_58">I'm not cut out for that, at least not yet. Most of it is empty conversations, sporadic contacts full of superficiality. Sometimes just looking for casual sex. Others, like in my case, a frustrated outlet for individuals who haven't let go of the burden of their ex-partner. At least I'm not blinded by hate. I quickly tired of the images with smiling photographs in a Persian market. I couldn't jump from one bed to another. There was a moment when I found myself chatting with five women at the same time. What's the point? How can they manage their schedules? I'm not particularly attractive, and yet, every day I received messages. It's absurd, I had to quit, now I feel more at peace.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-278">"And yet, with one stranger you did gain confidence."</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-279">I always forget that I can't fool grandpa. It's a bit frustrating, the old man supports me in my worst moments, but he reminds me of the harsh truths. Yes, there was a woman with whom an unexpected chemistry developed. It happened by chance, she was the one who contacted me, her photograph remained hidden. I liked her profile; cultured and educated, passionate about the arts, a piano teacher. Music, I've always been fascinated by music. The description didn't give many clues; divorced, with a daughter, average height, light eyes and blonde hair, medium length. Slim figure, with barely any curves and no particular aversion to tobacco. I had a hunch, a strange feeling, despite the hidden image of her face, in the background of the snapshot you could clearly make out the silhouette of the Colosseum in Rome. I sent her my phone number without hesitation, she reciprocated with an image of her face; pleasant, of a mature and serene woman, with rounded features and a small mole under her eye. Insignificant, at no point did it disturb her soft beauty. For a moment, I thought I recognized the trace of another woman, the unexpected imprint of a hidden desire. But no, her name wasn't Paola and, despite my longing, there were no similarities in her features, beyond her sun-kissed hair and sea-green eyes.</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_59">—For a week, you chatted with her every night.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-281">It's true, grandfather. I felt at ease, with a peaceful spirit. We talked about a thousand silly things, conversations from my childhood and anecdotes I had already forgotten. It was like discovering the past in someone else's life, foreign in the sense that I no longer conceive of a reality before the twenty-five years I've shared with my wife. And yet, there was my stranger, a nocturnal voice with whom I conversed about musical hits from the eighties, memories of a time full of hopes. We laughed, yes, we laughed at English song lyrics we didn't understand and that surprised us today with their sappy meaning. Each day we sent each other a song at the end of our chat to wish each other sweet dreams. A charming woman. A breath of fresh air in this dark living room where I sleep on a mattress on the wooden floor.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-282">—So many stories, every night you'd talk until two.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_60">Yes, grandfather. My God, so many stories; anecdotes from her work at the conservatory, outlandish experiences from her male dates, which she had maintained through the dating network, and unexpected events that left me open-mouthed. Like the night she told me what happened to her last summer during a visit to a village in the mountains of Madrid with her sister and nephews. They were caught in a tremendous downpour on a sunny day. The poor thing walked in the rain to the car, parked several kilometers outside the town center while the rest of the family waited impatiently at the door of a bar. With a tight, soaked dress, and a broken heel in her hand, she reached the car barefoot, under a torrent that drenched her to the bone. A cold and bed rest in the following days seemed assured. But she didn't flinch. Without thinking twice, she took off her clothes, wrung them out and put on only a flesh-colored bra with her pearly panties exposed. That's how she picked up the family and drove all the way back home, slowly on the road, praying that a pair of traffic police officers wouldn't stop her on the way back and she'd have to get out of the car in her underwear with her skinny little legs. How funny, her with me, me with her, how we laughed when she whispered it to me in that soft voice, it was as if she was playing the piano with her words.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-284">—Why did you stop talking to her?</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-285">—She was very dangerous, grandfather. We got along too well.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-286">Sometimes I wonder if the same thing happens to my wife, if she has found another voice that understands her and listens to her with that hope in her heart, if she has discovered that in the world there are souls so similar to ours waiting for a knock on the door.</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_61">Today, the number of deaths from the pandemic in our country doesn't reach fifty, the data is contradictory; the news talks about almost thirty thousand deaths according to health authorities. Although the National Institute of Statistics offers a list of more than forty-five thousand deaths compared to the death figures during this period last year. I don't know what to believe anymore. In the world, the disease continues to spread, except in Italy, where they are also beginning to see a glimmer of optimism. The applause at eight o'clock in the windows has already ceased, we neighbors have forgotten about it over the months, only the angry pot-banging of citizens against politicians can be heard. It hardly rains, although this nightmare continues, it gives the impression that we still have a long wait ahead. However, each day I worry more about another thought. What will the world be like when this confinement ends? It's a riddle for which I'm not prepared, I push it away with disdain in a nebula of incongruities. Too many questions, my head is spinning, speculations with old specters that overlap with new ones and create a monster of remorse. There's an unspeakable secret that assaults me these last nights, a cowardly act that I've never forgiven myself for. A petty action that I had buried in oblivion and that now plagues me again with the uneasiness of regret. In the darkness, lying on this dusty mattress, the heaviness makes me grind my teeth. Why did I do it? It's a crime I don't forgive myself for. It's in those moments when I feel like crying, but I don't know how to do it, I was never taught. It's the dilemma of men of my generation, we weren't educated for it. Things for sissies and whiners, they said. A man had to be firm as a rock, controlling his emotions. We swallow the pain, gulping down a stone in the stomach without a glass of water, and they haven't even left us the relief of tears. Who am I trying to fool, it's too late and there's no remedy, I committed an unworthy act. I turn over in bed again and cover my head with the sheet. At least this way, I avoid the gaze of my ghosts.</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-299" id="aid_166">VI</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-300" id="id-0-289">Today is Thursday, June 11th, the feast of Corpus Christi. The ringing of bells announces the celebration across the rooftops. An unusual commemoration, longed for when I was a child and would go to church with my grandfather for the Eucharistic celebration. In Madrid, it's no longer a holiday, thanks to the politicians. It's just another day, like any other. How quickly time passes, sixty days already since Easter Sunday, more than three months since we began the lockdown.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-301" id="aid_63">These past few weeks have gone by like a gust of wind, the calendar pages have fallen as quickly as a blink of an eye. In reality, it's as if time were standing still, silently awaiting the date of that new normal they talk about on the radio to start moving again. The days fall like grains of sand, disorienting me and making it difficult to keep track, it's an unconscious tick-tock. The summary of the day is limited to daily work at the mahogany desk by the window and walks with a mask accompanied by one of my children. The masks, how funny, now they're mandatory as soon as you step onto the street. So many campaigns for the freedom of dress for Muslim women and now no one is surprised that they force us to wear this burqa. Another contradiction in the media, they're not even sure if it will be effective.</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-302" id="id-0-291"><span class="class-0-303" id="id-0-292">The disease continues its expansion throughout the world, it's a wave that the wind pushes westward, driven in fits and starts by the virus. In America, the backwash of the tsunami is hitting their faces mercilessly. However, the images on television have given way to another tragedy. In the last ten days, cities have been burning with anger. A jungle of arms and legs cry out for justice in a new tide that spreads across the planet against the current. The brutal murder broadcast live of a black man by a white police officer has awakened consciousness against latent racial hatred. Millions of voices rise up: </span><span class="class-0-304" id="id-0-293">I can't breathe,</span><span class="class-0-303" id="id-0-294"> </span><span class="class-0-304" id="id-0-295">black lives matter</span><span class="class-0-303" id="id-0-296">. Lurking, COVID-19 remains eclipsed in homes, waiting for the protesters to return.</span></div></td></tr></table></body>
