It's not the first time I've insisted on this argument. The ghost walks around the marble table and stands to my right. I can almost feel his breath.</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-267">—It will be much worse if you continue with this farce.

You consider yourself intelligent and, deep down, you are a fool.</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_57">A fool. How right grandpa is. The children know, of course they do. I wouldn't be surprised if Jorge was aware of all our telematic adventures. He is a computer genius. Surely we have left clues. I would die of shame, with what moral authority could I look them in the eyes?</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-271">—Always worried about what they will say.</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-272">—I know, grandpa. I know, don't repeat it to me again.</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-273">The first time I discovered my wife's chats with another man, I went into a rage. I shouted with all the anger of my soul, I spat, I was about to hit her. It only lasted a moment, until she fixed her dark eyes on me and denied everything with that cold logic of a lawyer. I preferred to believe her despite the evidence. I took refuge in a chimera to maintain a facade that we both used as a masquerade. I don't ask and she pretends a calculated cordiality. Then I decided to try on my part. To enter that unknown world to investigate what she is trying to find in it.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-274">—A frustrating experience, right?</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-275">—Maybe I'm not ready or I don't know what I'm looking for.</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-276">—You didn't last long either, you unsubscribed in three weeks.</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_58">I'm not made of that stuff, at least not yet. Most of them are empty conversations, sporadic contacts full of superficiality. Sometimes looking only for no-strings-attached sex. Others, like in my case, a frustrated release of individuals who have not left behind the burden of their ex-partner. At least I am not blinded by hatred. I quickly got tired of the images with smiling photographs in a Persian market. I couldn't jump from one bed to another. There was a moment when I found myself chatting with five women at the same time. What sense does it make? How can they manage their agendas? I am not someone especially gifted, and, even so, every day I received messages. It's absurd, I had to quit, now I feel calmer.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-278">—And yet, with a stranger you gained confidence.</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-279">I always forget that I can't fool grandpa. It's a bit frustrating, the old man supports me in my worst moments, but he reminds me of the hard truths. Yes, there was a woman with whom an unexpected chemistry was born. It happened in a fortuitous way, it was she who contacted me, her photograph remained hidden. I liked the profile; cultured and educated, passionate about the arts, piano teacher. Music, I have always felt fascinated by music. The review didn't give many clues; divorced, with a daughter, medium height, light eyes and blonde hair, medium length. Slim silhouette, with hardly any curves and no special allergy to tobacco. I had a hunch, a strange feeling, despite the hidden image of her face, in the background of the snapshot the silhouette of the Colosseum in Rome could be clearly seen. I sent her my phone number without hesitation, she responded with the image of her face; pleasant, of a mature and serene woman, with rounded features and a small mole under her eye. Insignificant, at no moment did it disturb her soft beauty. For a moment, I thought I recognized the trace of another woman, the unexpected mark of the surprise of a hidden desire. But no, her name was not Paola and, despite my longing, there were no similarities in the features, beyond her sunny hair and her sea-green eyes.</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_59">"For a week, you chatted with her every night."</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-281">It's true, grandpa. I felt comfortable, at peace. We talked about a thousand silly things, conversations from my childhood and anecdotes that I had already forgotten. It was like discovering the past in someone else's life, alien in the sense that I no longer conceive a reality prior to the twenty-five years that I have shared with my wife. And, however, there was my unknown, a nocturnal voice with which I talked about musical successes in the eighties, memories of a time full of illusions. We laughed, yes, we laughed with lyrics of songs in English that we did not understand and that today surprised us for their cloying meaning. Every day we sent each other a song at the end of the chat to wish us sweet dreams. A charming woman. A breath of fresh air in this dark room where I sleep on a mattress on the wooden floor.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-282">"How many stories, the two of you made every night."</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_60">Yes, grandpa. My God, how many stories; jokes about her work at the conservatory, outlandish experiences in male dates, which she had maintained through the dating network, and unexpected events that left me speechless. Like the night she told me what happened to her last summer when she visited a town in the mountains of Madrid with her sister and nephews. They were caught in a tremendous downpour on a sunny day. The poor woman walked in the rain to the car, parked several kilometers outside the town while the rest of the family waited impatiently at the door of a bar. With a wet tight dress, and with a broken heel in her hand, she arrived at the car barefoot, under a torrent that soaked her to the bone. The cold and the convalescence in bed in the following days seemed to be assured. But she did not flinch. Without thinking twice, she took off her clothes, wrung them out and put on only a flesh-colored bra with her mother-of-pearl panties exposed. That's how she picked up the family and drove all the way back home, slowly on the road, praying that a couple of traffic guards would not stop her during the return and have to get out of the car in her underwear with her thin legs. What a joke, her with me, me with her, how we laughed when she told me in whispers with that soft voice, it was as if she was playing the piano with her words.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-284">"Why did you stop talking to her?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-285">"She was very dangerous, grandpa. We got along too well."</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="id-0-286">Sometimes I wonder if my wife is going through the same thing, if she has found another voice that understands and listens to her with that hope in her heart, if she has discovered that in the world there are souls so similar to ours waiting for a knock on the door.</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-240" id="aid_61">Today, the number of deaths from the pandemic in our country does not reach half a hundred, the data are contradictory; the news talks about almost thirty thousand deaths according to the health authorities. Although the National Institute of Statistics offers a list of more than forty-five thousand deaths with respect to the figures of deaths during this period last year. I no longer know what to believe. In the world, the disease continues its expansion, except in Italy, where they are also beginning to glimpse a light of certain optimism. The applause at eight in the windows has already ceased, the neighbors have been forgetting them with the passing of the months, only the angry caceroladas of the citizens against the politicians can be heard. It hardly rains, although this nightmare continues, it seems that we are still waiting for a long wait. However, every day I am more concerned about another thought. What will the world be like when this confinement ends? It is a riddle for which I do not find myself prepared, I put it aside with disdain in a nebula of incongruities. Too many questions, my head is spinning, speculations with old specters that overlap with the new ones and create a monster of remorse. There is an unspeakable secret that in these last nights assails me, a cowardly act that I have never forgiven myself. A mean action that I had buried in oblivion and that now torments me again with the discomfort of regret. In the darkness, lying on this dusty mattress, the heaviness makes me grind my teeth. Why did I do it? It is a crime that I do not forgive myself. It is in those moments when I feel like crying, but I do not know how to do it, they never taught me. It is the dilemma of the men of my generation, we were not educated for it. Things of nerds and whiners, they said. A man had to be firm as a rock, controlling his emotions. We swallowed the pain, swallowing a stone in the stomach without a glass of water, and they have not even left us the relief of tears. Who am I trying to fool, it is too late and there is no remedy, I committed an unworthy act. I give myself a new turn in bed and cover my head with the sheet. At least that way, I avoid the gaze of my ghosts.</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-299" id="aid_166">VI</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-300" id="id-0-289">Today is Thursday, June 11th, the day of Corpus Christi. The ringing of bells announces the celebration from the rooftops. An unusual date, longed for when I was a child and on which I would go to church with my grandfather to commemorate the Eucharist. In Madrid, it is no longer a holiday, things of politicians. It is just another day, like any other. How quickly time passes, sixty days since Easter Sunday, more than three months since we started the lockdown.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-301" id="aid_63">These last weeks have passed like a breath of wind, the leaves of the calendar have fallen with the speed of a blink. In reality, it is as if time were standing still, waiting quietly for the date of that new normality that they talk about on the radio to start. The days fall like grains of sand, they disorient me and I find it hard to keep track, it is an unconscious tick-tock. The summary of the day is limited to the daily work at the mahogany table by the window and the walks with a mask accompanied by one of my children. The masks, how funny, now they are mandatory as soon as you step out into the street. So many campaigns for the freedom of dress of Muslim women and now no one is surprised that we are forced to wear this burqa. Another contradiction of the media, they are not even sure if it will be effective.</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-302" id="id-0-291"><span class="class-0-303" id="id-0-292">The disease continues its expansion around the world, it is a wave that the wind displaces to the west, pushed by the virus. In America, the wake of the tsunami is hitting their faces without mercy. However, the images on television have given way to another tragedy. In the last ten days, the cities are burning with anger. A jungle of arms and legs shout for justice in a new tide that spreads across the planet against the current. The brutal murder broadcast live of a black man by a white policeman has awakened the conscience against a latent racial hatred. Millions of voices are raised: </span><span class="class-0-304" id="id-0-293">I can´t breathe,</span><span class="class-0-303" id="id-0-294"> </span><span class="class-0-304" id="id-0-295">black lives matter</span><span class="class-0-303" id="id-0-296">. Crouched, covid-19 remains eclipsed in homes, waiting for the return of the protesters.  </span></div></td></tr></table></body>
