The kids know, of course they know. It wouldn’t even surprise me if Jorge were in on our cybernetic adventures. He’s a genius with computers. I’m sure we’ve left tracks. I’d be embarrassed to death ―what moral authority would I then have over them?</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-284">“Always worried about other people’s opinion.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-285">“I know, Grandpa. I know, you don’t need to keep repeating it.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-286">When I first discovered that my wife was chatting with another man I was furious. I yelled at her, spewing out all the anger in my heart, I spat at her, I even came close to hitting her. It was only a moment ―until she fixed her dark eyes on me and flatly denied it with her attorney’s cold logic. I chose to believe her despite the evidence. I took refuge in an illusion to keep up a front we can both use as a masquerade. I don’t ask any questions and she feigns a distant politeness. Then I decided to try it out. To penetrate that unfamiliar world and discover what she’s seeking there.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-287">“A disappointing experience, wasn’t it?”    </div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-288">“Maybe I’m not ready or I don’t really know what I’m looking for.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-289">“Well, you didn’t stay very long; you unsubscribed after three weeks.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="aid_55">I’m not that type of person, at least not yet. Most of it is idle chatter, utterly superficial sporadic contacts. Some people are just seeking casual sex. Others, like me, who haven’t gotten over their former partners, just want to vent their frustrations. At least I’m not blinded by hatred. I quickly got tired of the bazaar exhibit of smiling pictures. I wouldn’t be able to jump from bed to bed. At some point I was chatting with five women at once. What’s the point? How can they manage their agendas? I’m not particularly good-looking and, yet, I would get messages every single day. It was absurd; I had to drop out. Now I feel calmer.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-291">“Still, you did get close to one stranger.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="aid_56">I always forget I can’t deceive Grandpa. It’s a bit annoying; the old man supports me when I’m in the pits, but he also confronts me with the plain truth. Yes, there were unexpected good vibes with one woman. It was fortuitous. She contacted me with her picture concealed. I liked her profile: educated, cultivated, with a passion for the arts, a piano teacher. Music, I’ve always been fascinated by music. The description didn’t give many clues: divorced, with a daughter, medium height, light-colored eyes and blond, shoulder-length hair. A slim silhouette, with hardly any curves, and no aversion to smoking. I had a gut feeling, a weird hunch ―although the picture didn’t show her face, I could clearly discern the shape of Rome’s Coliseum in the background. I gave her my phone number right away and she reciprocated with her picture: that of a serene middle-aged woman with a pleasant round face and a small wart below the eye. A trifle ―it didn’t tarnish her soft beauty at all. For a moment I thought I recognized the imprint of another woman, the remarkable trace of a hidden desire. But no, her name was not Paola and, despite my yearning, there was no resemblance other than the sunny hair and the sea green eyes.</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-293">“For a week you chatted with her every night.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-294">It’s true, Grandpa. I felt comfortable, at peace. We talked about all sorts of nonsense, including my childhood and anecdotes I had already forgotten. It was like discovering the past in an alien life ―alien in the sense that I can no longer envisage a life before the twenty-five years I’ve shared with my wife. However, there was my stranger, a nocturnal voice with whom I discussed 1980s hits, memories of an era full of dreams. We laughed, oh yes, we laughed at the lyrics of English songs we didn’t understand at the time and whose sugary meaning now amazed us. At the end of the chat, we would send each other a song as a sweet dreams wish. A charming woman. A breath of fresh air in the darkness of this living room where I sleep on a mattress on the wooden floor.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-295">“You shared many stories every night.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="aid_57">Yes, Grandpa. Gosh, so many stories ―jokes about her work at the conservatory, outlandish experiences during her dates through the app and odd incidents that made my jaw drop. Like when she told me about a visit to a town in the Sierra of Madrid with her sister and her nieces and nephews last summer. It was a sunny day, but they were caught in a dreadful rainstorm. Her car was parked several kilometers from the town center and the poor woman had to go fetch it under a deluge, while the rest of the family waited impatiently by the door of a bar. She finally reached the car, barefoot, with a broken heel in her hand and her tight dress soaking wet. She was sure she’d catch a cold and spend a few days in bed. But that didn’t daunt her. She simply took off her clothes, wrung them out and kept only her flesh color bra and her pearl color panties. That’s how she picked up the family and drove all the way home, slowly, praying that the Civil Guard wouldn’t stop her and she’d have to get off the car and stand on her skinny legs in her underwear. It was so funny! We laughed so much while she recounted the story in a sweet, hushed voice, as if playing the piano with her words.        </div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-297">“Why did you stop chatting with her?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-298">“She was very dangerous, Grandpa. We got along too well.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="id-0-299">Sometimes I wonder if the same thing has happened to my wife ―if she’s found another voice that understands her and listens to her with a hopeful heart; if she’s discovered that there are souls out there very similar to ours just waiting for a knock on the door.</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-253" id="aid_59">Today, the number of deaths caused by the pandemic is less than fifty; the data are conflicting, though. Quoting the health authorities, the TV news talk about almost thirty thousand deaths, while the National Statistics Institute has a list of over forty-five thousand excess deaths as compared to the same period last year. I don’t know what to believe anymore. The disease continues to spread around the world, except for Italy, where there’s also a certain glimpse of optimism. The eight-o’clock applause at the windows has stopped ―as the months passed, the residents forgot about it. Now, the only noise comes from the angry pot-banging protests against the politicians. It hardly rains anymore, though the nightmare continues; it seems there’s still a long way to go. Yet, I’m increasingly concerned about something else. What will the world be like when the confinement’s over? It’s a riddle I’m not prepared to solve. I push it aside disdainfully, immersed in a haze of contradictions. Too many questions; my head is spinning ―lucubrations about old specters superimposed onto new ones which create a monstrous remorse. Lately, my shameful secret has been haunting me at night; a cowardly act I’ve never forgiven myself for. A wretched action I had managed to bury away and now badgers me again with a harrowing sense of regret; the anguish makes me grind my teeth in the dark, lying on this dusty mattress. Why did I do it? It was an unpardonable crime. At those times I feel like crying, but I don’t know how ―I was never taught. That’s the dilemma men of my generation face ―we weren’t educated to do so. It’s for sissies and moaners, we were told. A man had to be solid as a rock and keep his emotions under control. We swallow pain, gobble down stones without any water, but aren’t offered the relief tears bring. Who am I kidding? Now it’s too late, nothing can be done about it; it was a despicable deed. I turn in the bed again and cover my head with the sheets. This way I can at least avoid the gaze of my ghosts.      </div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-312" id="aid_163">VI</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-313" id="id-0-302">Today is Thursday, June eleventh, Corpus Christi Day. Church bells are tolling over the roofs to announce the celebration. It’s an outdated festivity; as a child, I enjoyed going to church with Grandpa to commemorate the institution of the Eucharist. In Madrid, it’s no longer a holiday ―for political reasons, I assume. How time flies! It’s already been sixty days since Easter, over three months since the confinement started.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-314" id="id-0-303">These last few weeks have gone by like a breath of wind; the calendar pages have fallen in the blink of an eye. Actually, it seems like time has stopped still and is stealthily waiting for the beginning of the new normality they talk about on the radio to get moving again. The days fall like grains of sand; I’m disoriented and it’s hard for me to keep track of them ―it’s an unconscious tick-tock. All I do is work on the mahogany table by the window and take masked walks with one of the kids. It’s funny, masks are now mandatory from the moment you step into the street. All those campaigns for Muslim women’s right to freedom of dress… and now no one objects to having to wear a sort of burka! Yet another paradox of the mass media ―they’re not even sure of its effectiveness.</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-315" id="aid_61"><span class="class-0-316" id="id-0-305">The disease continues to expand around the world; the wave is being swept to the west, pushed in spurts by the virus. The tail of the tsunami is hitting America ruthlessly. However, the TV images have given way to another tragedy. For the past ten days, cities have been burning with fury. A jungle of arms and legs cry out for justice in a new surge that’s spreading all over the planet. The live broadcast of a Black man being brutally killed by a white cop has raised awareness of the prevailing racial hatred. Millions of voices scream, “</span><span class="class-0-317" id="id-0-306">I can’t breathe, Black lives matter</span><span class="class-0-316" id="id-0-307">.”</span><a class="class-0-319" href="xhtml-0-21.xhtml#aid_165" id="id-0-308"><span id="aid_161"></span>[1]</a><span class="class-0-316" id="id-0-309"> Though it still lurks in the shadows, COVID-19 has been eclipsed inside the homes ―people are now on the lookout for the next protest.  </span></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
