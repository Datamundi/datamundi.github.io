<body><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Content</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-853">As she was early, she decided to have breakfast out and she went into a Starbucks near the office. She ordered a café latte and a croissant. She sat down at a table to eat and she was just biting into the delicious pastry when she saw Kaine getting out of a taxi accompanied by a drop-dead gorgeous blonde. She frowned when she saw him grab her by the waist and she nearly choked on her croissant when she saw the woman throw herself upon him and kiss him on the lips. And the idiot didn’t even try to get her off!</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-854">She furiously watched as Kaine smiled whilst he said something, then gave her a kiss on the cheek to say goodbye. About to explode with rage, she was left staggered when the blonde gave Kaine a pat on the backside right in front of the main doors, under the attentive gaze of the doorman and various executives, who did not miss a thing.</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-855">Clearly after she had left Kaine’s apartment he had wasted no time at all. He had obviously gone out on the chase because his chauffeur hadn’t taken him to work. She picked up her coffee and crossed the road to enter the office.</div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-856">“Emma you won’t believe the woman that arrived with the boss,” gossiped Jeff the doorman.</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-857">Emma smiled weakly. “You’re kidding me?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="aid_67">“Yeah, she looked like a model,” he said, confidentially. “She even gave him a pat on the butt, laughing. The boss looked delighted…”</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-859">“Great,” she said, trying to get past, but Jeff stopped her.</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-860">“I’d not be surprised if we saw more of her, they clearly got on very well.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-861">“Jeff, I’m in a bit of a hurry,” she said, trying not to be rude. “If you find out anything else let me know, okay?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-862">“I’ll keep my ear to the ground,” he said in a conspiratorial tone.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-863">The whole building would know about it in half an hour. Furious, she entered the elevator. She’d get her own back on the slimeball.</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-864">Her cellphone rang as she left the elevator and she carefully balanced her coffee in her other hand to answer it. “Hello?” she said, entering her office.</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-865">“How’s everything going?” asked Marie.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-866">“We have to talk,” she hissed.</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-867">“Don’t tell me you’ve slept with him.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-868">“I wasn’t the lucky one.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-869">“That boy is an idiot,” Marie groaned.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-870">Emma laughed, placing her coffee down on her desk. “He’s not exactly a boy.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-871">“Well he acts like one. I’ll think of something.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-872">“I think it’s best to leave it,” she said, turning serious. “This isn’t going to work out.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-873">“Of course it is, just you leave it to me.” Marie hung up the phone and Emma sighed.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-874">She put down her bag and sat down. A few seconds later she grimaced and turned on the coffee machine.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-875">“Ah, you’re here,” said Kaine with a smile.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-876">“Yes, and today I’m leaving at lunchtime,” she said triumphantly whilst wishing she could kill him.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="aid_68">“A bet is a bet,” he said indifferently.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-878">Emma narrowed her eyes wondering the coffee pot would look like over his head, “You’re right.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-879">Emma’s phone rang again and she returned to her desk. “Hi, Sondra.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-880">“Everything’s sorted.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-881">“What for?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-882">“For our trip to the Hamptons this weekend,” she said irritably. “Had you forgotten?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-883">“Of course not!” Emma smiled. She perched on the edge of her desk then glanced at Kaine sideways who was not missing any of it. “I’ve got my bikini ready.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-817" id="id-0-884">“Perfect!
