<body><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Content</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="aid_73">As she had plenty of time, she decided to have breakfast out and entered a Starbucks near the office. She ordered a latte and a croissant. She sat at the table to eat her croissant and was chewing the delicious pastry when she saw Kaine getting out of a taxi accompanied by a stunning blonde. She frowned when she saw him put his arm around her waist and almost choked when she saw the woman throw herself at him, planting a kiss on his lips. And the idiot didn't do anything to pull away from her! Furious, she watched as Kaine smiled while saying something to her and ended up giving her a kiss on the cheek as a goodbye. About to explode, she was left with her mouth open when the woman gave Kaine a slap on the butt, right in front of the office door under the watchful eye of the doorman and several executives who didn't miss a detail.</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-848">Apparently, after she left his apartment, Kaine hadn't wasted any time. It was clear that he had gone hunting since his driver hadn't taken him to work. She grabbed her coffee and crossed the street to enter the office.</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-849">"Emma, you wouldn't believe how hot the woman who came with the boss was," said the doorman, gossiping.</div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-850">Emma smiled weakly. "You don't say."</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-851">"Yes, she looked like a model," he said in a confidential tone. "She even gave him a slap on the butt, laughing. And the boss was delighted..."</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-852">"I'm glad," she said trying to pass, but Jeff blocked her way.</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-853">"I wouldn't be surprised if we saw her often. You could tell they got along very well."</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-854">"Jeff, I'm in a bit of a hurry," she said trying not to be rude. "If you find out anything else, let me know, okay?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-855">"I'll keep my ear to the ground," he said in a conspiratorial tone.</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-856">The whole building would know in half an hour. Furious, she entered the elevator. That horny bastard was going to get it.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-857">Her mobile rang as she left the elevator and, careful not to spill her coffee, she answered it. "Hello?" she said entering her office.</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-858">"How's everything going?" Marie asked.</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-859">"We need to talk," she said through gritted teeth.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-860">"Don't tell me you slept with him."</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-861">"I wasn't the lucky one."</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="aid_74">Marie growled, "This boy is an idiot."</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-863">Emma laughed, putting the coffee on the table. "He's not exactly a boy."</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-864">"Well, he's acting like one. I'll think of something."</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-865">"I think it's better to let it go," she said worriedly. "This isn't going to end well."</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-866">"Of course it will, just leave it to me." Marie hung up the phone and Emma sighed.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-867">She put down her purse and sat down. She got up again after a few seconds and turned on the coffee maker, making a face.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-868">"Ah, you're here already," Kaine said smiling.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-869">"Yes, and today I'm leaving at lunchtime," she said triumphantly, wanting to kill him.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-870">"A bet is a bet," he said indifferently.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-871">Emma narrowed her eyes, thinking how the coffee maker would look on his head. "Indeed."</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-872">Emma's mobile rang again and she went to the desk. "Hi Sondra."</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-873">"Everything is ready."</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-874">"What for?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-875">"To go to the Hamptons this weekend," she said angrily. "Have you forgotten?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-876">Emma smiled. "Of course not!" she said, leaning her backside against the desk and then glancing sideways at Kaine who was taking in every detail. "I have my bikini ready."</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-877">"Well, perfect! We're leaving this afternoon. We'll catch the bus at six."</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-878">"I'll be ready," she said, amused.</div></td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="aid_75">"We're going to have a blast! I've got everything covered."</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-880">"Really?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-881">"Reservations at restaurants and I was even thinking of booking a spa."</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-882">"A spa, that sounds nice," she said in a sensual voice.</div></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-883">"Are you feeling alright? You're not coming down with a cold, are you?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-884">Emma laughed. "See you later."</div></td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-885">After hanging up, she grabbed her coffee and sat at her desk, ignoring her boss.</div></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-886">"So you're going away for the weekend," he said in a deep voice.</div></td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-887">"That's right," she said smiling. "We're going to the beach."</div></td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-888">"It'll be the perfect time to break in that negligee, if you find someone to do it with, of course."</div></td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-889">"Brilliant idea." She turned on the computer and started working.</div></td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-890">"And where are you going?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-891">"To the Hamptons."</div></td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-892">"What a coincidence, I'm going there this weekend too," he said, satisfied.</div></td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-893">"Fortunately, we don't move in the same circles," she replied, smiling sweetly.</div></td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-894">"You never know," he said mysteriously as he entered his office.</div></td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-895">She frowned, trying to decipher what he meant.</div></td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-896">She worked hard all morning so that her absence wouldn't be too noticeable in the afternoon. "Emma, come to my office," he said just as she was about to leave.</div></td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="aid_76">Narrowing her eyes, she opened the office door. "Come in," he said, seeing that she wasn't moving from the doorway.</div></td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-898">She did so reluctantly and approached the desk. "Do you need something? I was about to leave."</div></td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-899">He relaxed in his chair, looking at her intently. "I was wondering how far you're going to go."</div></td></tr><tr><td>54</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-900">"Excuse me?" she asked, confused.</div></td></tr><tr><td>55</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-901">"In your resistance to sleeping with me."</div></td></tr><tr><td>56</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-902">Emma looked at him in disbelief. This man was utterly shameless. "So what you want to know is when I'll sleep with you?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>57</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-903">Kaine laughed. "Come on, Emma. You desire me!"</div></td></tr><tr><td>58</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-904">She blushed with fury and indignation. "You're right, I'm crazy about you," she said, mocking him. "So much that I think my panties might drop at any moment."</div></td></tr><tr><td>59</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-905">Kaine frowned when he saw her angry. "Emma..."</div></td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-906">"Listen carefully, you self-centered pervert, I wouldn't sleep with a pig like you even if I were desperate! If I want to get laid, I just have to go out on the street and pick a man! New York is full of them!"</div></td></tr><tr><td>61</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-907">"Don't get angry, Emma," he said, standing up.</div></td></tr><tr><td>62</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-908">"Don't you dare come any closer or I'll report you for harassment!"</div></td></tr><tr><td>63</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-909">"That's not funny at all," he replied, getting angry.</div></td></tr><tr><td>64</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-910">"Oh no? Well, it's not funny either that you ask me when I'm going to sleep with you as if I were a slut." She pointed her finger at him. "You tried it yesterday and then you left with someone else. Go call her again!"</div></td></tr><tr><td>65</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="aid_77">She turned around furiously. "Who told you I left with someone else?" he asked, astonished.</div></td></tr><tr><td>66</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-912">"The whole company knows!"</div></td></tr><tr><td>67</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-913">"Are you jealous?" he asked with a smile, following her outside.</div></td></tr><tr><td>68</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-914">"You wish, jerk." She was about to head for the elevator when Kaine grabbed her by the arm.</div></td></tr><tr><td>69</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-915">"Oh no, you're not leaving like this." He turned her around, grabbing her by the waist while Emma struggled.</div></td></tr><tr><td>70</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-916">"If you don't let me go, I'm going to scream," she hissed, and her eyes widened when he lowered his hands from her waist to her buttocks, squeezing them and pulling her against him. "Are you crazy?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>71</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-917">He smiled, lowering his head to kiss her, and Emma turned her head, kissing her on the earlobe. She moaned when he didn't give up and bit her earlobe, caressing it with his tongue.</div></td></tr><tr><td>72</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-918">"Excuse me, should I come back later?" Martin asked, amused to see them in that position.</div></td></tr><tr><td>73</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-919">Kaine gave her a kiss on the neck before releasing her with a smile and turning to his friend. "What brings you here?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>74</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-920">"Could I talk to you about this weekend?" he asked enigmatically.</div></td></tr><tr><td>75</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-921">"Sure, come into my office," he said, giving Emma a pat on the bottom that made her blush intensely.</div></td></tr><tr><td>76</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-922">"You..."</div></td></tr><tr><td>77</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-923">"See you later, honey," he said, entering his office.</div></td></tr><tr><td>78</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-924">She left there furious and picked up the phone. "You know what your horny son just said to me?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>79</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="aid_78">Marie burst out laughing after hearing the story. "He's just like his father," she said proudly. "He won't stop until he gets what he wants."</div></td></tr><tr><td>80</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-926">"That's it, I'm not going to continue with this. I don't want anything to do with that... that..."</div></td></tr><tr><td>81</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-927">"Darling, you're crazy about him."</div></td></tr><tr><td>82</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-928">"That's not true. I'm sure all this is in my subconscious because you won't stop talking about him."</div></td></tr><tr><td>83</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-929">"Was I the one who forced you to kiss him at my house?" she asked, amused.</div></td></tr><tr><td>84</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-930">Emma growled. "He's going to pay for this. For that stupid girl this morning and for treating me like one of his little friends."</div></td></tr><tr><td>85</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-931">"And what are you going to do?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>86</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-932">"You know where I'm spending the weekend?" she said mischievously. "In the Hamptons."</div></td></tr><tr><td>87</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-933">Marie burst out laughing. "I can't wait to hear about your achievements!"</div></td></tr><tr><td>88</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-934">"You wouldn't happen to have an attractive young man who could compete with him, would you?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>89</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-935">"You're giving me an idea," she said enigmatically. "I'll call you later."</div></td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td><div class="class-0-853" id="id-0-936">She was packing her suitcase when her phone rang. "Have you found someone decent yet?"</div></td></tr><tr><td>91</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-937">Marie burst out laughing.
