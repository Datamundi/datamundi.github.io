That was the basis of a good player, not showing others what he was hiding between his hands, but his face flushed involuntarily. The ace of spades and the three of clubs had been his first cards, and although he prayed that fortune was on his side giving him the chance to keep her in the club for longer, it was not.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-540" xml:lang="en">"Show them," he muttered angrily.

Valeria snapped, her eyes widening.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-547" xml:lang="en">"Do you think the money is in my pockets?" He demanded, arching his dark brows. "Upstairs in my office, I'll be able to pay off my debt. Indeed, some privacy will do you good. You don't want to be robbed by a thief hiding on the premises? Although I invest an incredible fortune to keep my club protected, I fear that more than one gentleman who prowls these salons are swindlers in disguise,” he pointed out.</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="aid_58" xml:lang="es"><span id="id-0-549" xml:lang="en">Valeria swallowed hard and reached for the eight chips she needed to collect her payment, looking away from Mr. Trevor to them. In her hand she held the dream she had wanted so much and finally could pay off the promise she made to her mother. There was only one step left; go up to that man's office and make the exchange. However, that hunch that had come to her since Mr. Reform had been prowling the halls intensified. Was it because of the sarcasm he had used in her words? </span><span class="class-0-508" id="id-0-550" xml:lang="en">Swindlers in disguise</span><span id="id-0-551" xml:lang="en">... Did he know the truth? Or maybe it was all a figment of her imagination? What would happen upstairs? Was there someone else in that place?</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-552" xml:lang="en">"Don't you want your earnings, Mr. Hernandez?" Trevor persisted, turning around.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-553" xml:lang="en">"You promised," Valeria growled in a low voice.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-554" xml:lang="en">"And I will not break my promise. But if you want it, you only must accept one condition; to come with me upstairs,” he added without flinching. "Are you afraid, Mr. Hernandez? Are you hiding something that I shouldn't find out?” he asked her.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-555" xml:lang="en">"No, of course not," she stated flatly.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-499" id="id-0-556" xml:lang="en">"Then follow me. The sooner we pay off this debt, the sooner you can leave because, if I don't remember incorrectly, you were in a hurry,” he said, turning toward the door.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-568" id="aid_59" xml:lang="en">Valeria watched that tall, burly figure leave the room. Fear, the emotion Mr. Reform had referred to, had paralyzed her. She couldn't take a single step, couldn't breathe normally. She squeezed the chips in her hand as she remembered Kristel and the children. They waited for her at home, just as they waited for her to fulfill the dreams she talked about so much. The crossroads were approaching; go up and get the money or flee from that place, implying that she had deceived the owner of the club himself. No, she hadn't cheated in the game and what she was hiding under her clothes, she shouldn't think about. She was a man, Mr. Hernandez, and as such, she needed to maintain the attitude of a respectable and honorable gentleman. She put the chips in her left pocket, took a deep breath, and advanced towards that great figure who entered the darkness of the hall.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-570" id="aid_600" xml:lang="en">VI</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-573" id="id-0-561" xml:lang="es"><span class="class-0-574" id="id-0-562" xml:lang="en">She </span><span id="id-0-563" xml:lang="en">climbed the stairs to the right of the hall, right behind the large alabaster pillars that adorned the front door, counting them while she was ascending. Twenty in all. Twenty wide and harrowing dark wood steps that would lead her to the office of the man who would make her keep her promise to her brothers. When Valeria reached the landing, she could not help but look down and, as she had once imagined, contemplated the immensity of the place. In the center, the long and wide hall welcomed those who entered the gaming rooms. How many gentlemen could roam the area? Eighty, one hundred? Their well-coiffed heads moved like a hundred busy ants.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-564" xml:lang="en">Valeria tore her gaze away from them and pinned it to the end of the hall. There was the drawing room. She never made it to that area, but she knew what she would find in the last room. As she had heard, the gentlemen came to this place to relax while reading, chatting, drinking in front of the warmth of a great fireplace or savoring the exquisite dinners that the cook prepared each night. She supposed it was the perfect space to talk about business, politics, or perhaps hide from the world around them.</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="aid_61" xml:lang="es"><span id="id-0-566" xml:lang="en">She looked back at the door through which she was to enter. An orange light emerged from it. Valeria held her breath when she caught a glimpse of the movement of the flames. </span><span class="class-0-579" id="id-0-567" xml:lang="en">Go ahead</span><span id="id-0-568" xml:lang="en">, she encouraged herself. She took a deep breath and stood in front of the doorway to contemplate what was inside. The assumptions about what Mr. Reform was hiding in his office were innumerable. They even rumored that he had summoned a blacksmith to forge a cage large enough to accommodate those who dared to rob him.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-569" xml:lang="en">But that conjecture was not true. The interior of the office could be equal to any other, except for the dimensions of the desk and the huge sofa placed to its left. She remained motionless for a few moments, during which he did not deign to lift his eyes from the papers he was reading, and studied every corner of the room meticulously. In addition to that large sofa, where she imagined he would sleep from time to time, there was a table that could reach a length of eighty inches. However, it was not large enough to hold all those papers that were on it. Valeria could swear there wasn't a tiny space left unoccupied. When she focused on him, her eyes widened. As illogical as it was, Mr. Reform had removed his suit jacket, keeping that dark waistcoat and pearl-colored shirt, which, to her regret, had unbuttoned several buttons, revealing some black hair. How could he be so bold? The right thing to do would be to continue to dress appropriately when a visit is expected. Although, from what she could see, this man had not a shred of modesty and did not understand social protocols.</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="aid_62" xml:lang="en">In silence, she looked at the large armchair in which he was sitting. Dark, sober, and shining. Was it made of real leather? Probably… Two chairs, with curved backs, were positioned in front of him. Of course, in order not to clash with the surrounding hue, the color was also dark. From where she stood, she couldn't tell if they were black or brown. She looked down at the floor she was about to step on. From the entrance a long, narrow carpet was spread over it with an elaborate pattern of Turkish warriors raising their horses. Valeria concluded that, despite warning that everything stored there could cost a fortune, Mr. Reform was trying to appease the ostentation that manifested downstairs with a simple decoration. If that was what he wanted to suggest, he had succeeded because it was a simple room and due to the comforting warmth of the fireplace, even pleasant.</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-571" xml:lang="en">"Do you intend to stand there for the rest of the night? I have a lot of work to do and you were in a hurry to leave,” Trevor said after watching her look around her with considerable anticipation.</div></td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-572" xml:lang="en">What would she think she would find? Would a dragon be lying by the fire? Or maybe that iron cage that everyone was talking about? A small smile curved his lips but disappeared as he remembered that he must fulfill his promise as soon as possible.</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-573" xml:lang="en">"I only admired what others have failed to see," Valeria answered with that tone of voice that was beginning to hurt her throat.</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-574" xml:lang="en">"Well, if you're already satisfied, you can settle into one of those chairs," he said, taking the cut-glass bottle that he had left and filling one of the glasses to the brim.</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-575" xml:lang="en">"Do you need to sit me down? Can't you get up and give me the money right here? Maybe my grimy shoes will stain this nice and expensive rug,” she said evasively.</div></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-576" xml:lang="en">"Don't waste any more time..." he grumbled. "Come in once and shut that damn door," he continued in that angry tone. "I don't want anyone else to witness this unusual humiliation."</div></td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td><div class="class-0-576" id="id-0-577" xml:lang="en">"Humiliation?" Valeria blurted out stunned.</div></td></tr></table></body></html>
