There were the eight hundred pounds of her opponent. What should she do? She closed her eyes for a moment to calculate what cards Mr. Reform could have. The data was not enough to find a correct resolution. She had a six of hearts, which she could use with the six of spades to make a pair, and a jack of clubs.</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-881">"Sir?"

That was the basis of a good player, not to show others what he was hiding in his hands, but his face blushed involuntarily. The ace of spades and the three of clubs had been his first cards and, although he prayed that fortune would be on his side, granting him the possibility of having her in the club for a longer time, it was not granted.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-816" id="id-0-893"><span class="class-0-812" id="id-0-894">"I see them," he murmured angrily.

"Upstairs, in my office, I will be able to settle my debt. Besides, you will have some privacy. You don't want to be robbed by some thief hiding in the place, do you? Because, although I invest an incredible fortune to keep my club protected, I fear that more than one gentleman who roams the halls is a disguised scammer," he pointed out sarcastically.</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-861" id="aid_58"><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-905">Valeria swallowed, stretched out her hands towards</span><span class="class-0-918" id="id-0-906"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-907">the eight</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-908"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-909">chips</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-910"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-911">that</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-912"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-913">she</span><span class="class-0-926" id="id-0-914"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-915">had to</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-916"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-917">collect</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-918"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-919">to</span><span class="class-0-926" id="id-0-920"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-921">make</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-922"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-923">that</span><span class="class-0-926" id="id-0-924"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-925">payment and looked away from Trevor to direct it towards them. In her hand she had the dream she had long desired and finally fulfill the promise she made to her mother. She only had one step left, go up to that man's office and make the exchange. However, that hunch that had assailed her since Reform had been roaming the halls, intensified. Was it because of the sarcasm he had used in his words? "Disguised scammers...". Did he know the truth? Or maybe it was all a product of her imagination? What would happen upstairs? Would there be anyone else in that place?</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-936" id="id-0-924">"Don't you want your winnings, Mr. Hernández?" Trevor persisted, turning around.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-937" id="id-0-925">"You promised me," Valeria growled in a low voice.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-938" id="id-0-926">"And I won't break my promise. But if you want it, you only have to accept one condition: that you accompany me upstairs," he added without flinching. "Are you afraid, Mr. Hernández? Are you hiding something that I shouldn't discover?" he taunted.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-927">"No, of course not," he declared firmly.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-928">"Then follow me. The sooner we settle this debt, the sooner you can leave because, if I remember correctly, you were in a hurry," he said, turning towards the door.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-941" id="id-0-929">Valeria watched that tall and burly figure leave the room. Fear, the one Mr. Reform had referred to, had paralyzed her. She couldn't take a single step, nor breathe normally. She clutched the chips in her hand while remembering Kristel and the children. They were waiting for her at home, just as they expected her to fulfill the dreams she talked about so much. The crossroads was growing bigger: go up and get the money or run away from that place implying that she had deceived the very owner of the club. No, she hadn't cheated in the game and about what she was hiding under her clothes, she shouldn't think about it. He was a man, Mr. Hernández, and as such, he needed to maintain the attitude of a respectable and honest gentleman. She put the chips in her left pocket, took a deep breath, and walked towards that grandiose figure that entered the darkness of the hallway.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-943" id="aid_577">VI</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-946" id="id-0-933"><span class="class-0-947" id="id-0-934">She climbed</span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-935"> the stairs located on the right side of the </span><span class="class-0-949" id="id-0-936">hall</span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-937">, just behind the large alabaster pillars that adorned the main door. She counted them as she ascended. Twenty in total. Twenty wide and anxious steps of dark wood that would lead her to the office of the man who would help her fulfill the promise she made to her brothers. When she reached the landing, she couldn't help but look down and, just as she had imagined once before, she contemplated the immensity of the place. In the center, the long and wide hallway welcomed anyone who ventured into the gaming rooms. How many gentlemen could roam the area? Eighty, a hundred? Their heads, well-groomed, moved like a hundred busy ants.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-938">Valeria looked away from them and fixed her gaze at the end of the hallway. There was the lounge. She had never reached that area, but she knew what she would find in the last room. According to what she heard, gentlemen went there to relax while reading, chatting, drinking in front of the warmth of a grand fireplace, or savoring the exquisite dinners that the chef prepared every night. She assumed it was the ideal space to talk about business, politics, or perhaps, to hide from the world around them. She turned her gaze back to the door she had to enter. An orange light emerged from it. Valeria held her breath when she glimpsed the movement of the flames on the shiny and smooth surface. "Go ahead," she encouraged herself. She took a deep breath and positioned herself in front of the entrance to see what was inside.</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="aid_60">The assumptions about what Mr. Reform was hiding in his office were countless. They even rumored that he had called a blacksmith to forge a cage large enough to hold those who dared to rob him. But that conjecture was not true. The interior of the office could be compared to any other, except for its dimensions and the enormous sofa placed to his left. He remained motionless for a few moments, during which he did not bother to lift his eyes from the papers he was reading, and she studied every corner of the room meticulously. In addition to that large sofa, where she imagined he would sleep from time to time, there was a table that could reach a length of eighty inches. However, it was not large enough to hold all the papers that were on it. Valeria could swear that there was not a single tiny space unoccupied.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-953" id="id-0-940"><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-941">When she focused her attention on him, she opened her eyes wide. As illogical as it seemed to her, Mr. Reform had taken off his jacket, leaving him with that dark vest and pearl-colored shirt, of which, to her dismay, he had unbuttoned several buttons showing some black hair. How could he behave with such impudence? The correct thing to do was to continue dressed appropriately when a visit was expected, but from what she had discovered, that man had no sense of modesty or understanding of social protocols.</span><span class="class-0-955" id="id-0-942"> </span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-943"></span></div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="aid_61">In silence, she observed the large armchair in which he was sitting. Dark, sober, and shiny. Was it made of genuine leather? Probably... Two chairs, with a curvilinear backrest, were positioned in front of him. Of course, to match the tone of their surroundings, the color was also dark; from where she was, she couldn't tell if they were black or brown. She lowered her gaze to the floor she was about to step on. From the entrance, a long and narrow carpet extended with an elaborate design of Turkish warriors raised on their horses. Valeria concluded that, despite noticing that everything kept there could cost a fortune, Mr. Reform tried to appease the ostentation he displayed on the floor below with a simple decor. If that was what he wanted to show, he had succeeded because it seemed to her a rather simple room and, due to the comforting warmth of the fireplace, even pleasant.</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-953" id="id-0-945"><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-946">"Do you intend to stay there standing for the rest</span><span class="class-0-960" id="id-0-947"> </span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-948">of the night?

A dragon lying next to the fire? Or perhaps that iron cage that everyone talked about? A small smile curved her lips, but it disappeared when she remembered that she had to fulfill her promise as soon as possible.</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-950">"I was just admiring what others have not been able to see," Valeria replied with that tone of voice that was starting to hurt her throat.</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-951">"Well, if you are already satisfied, you can sit in one of those chairs," he indicated, taking the crystal bottle that was on his left and filling one of the glasses to the brim.</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-952">"Do you need me to sit down?

"Come in and close that damn door," he continued in an angry tone.
