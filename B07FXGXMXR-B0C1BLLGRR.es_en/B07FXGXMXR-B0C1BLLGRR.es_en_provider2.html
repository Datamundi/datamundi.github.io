There were her opponent's eight hundred pounds. What should she do? She closed her eyes for a moment to calculate what cards Mr. Reform might have. The data wasn't enough to find the right solution. She had a six of hearts, which she could use with the six of spades to make a pair, and a jack of clubs.</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-881">"Sir?"

That was the basis of a good player, not showing others what he was hiding in his hands, but his face involuntarily flushed. The ace of spades and the three of clubs had been his first cards and, although he prayed for fortune to be on his side, granting him the possibility of having her in the club for longer, it was not granted.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-816" id="id-0-893"><span class="class-0-812" id="id-0-894">"I call," he muttered angrily.

Because, although I invest an incredible fortune to keep my club protected, I'm afraid more than one gentleman lurking in the halls are disguised swindlers," he pointed out sarcastically.</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-861" id="aid_58"><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-905">Valeria swallowed hard, reached out towards</span><span class="class-0-918" id="id-0-906"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-907">the eight</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-908"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-909">chips</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-910"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-911">she</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-912"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-913">had to</span><span class="class-0-926" id="id-0-914"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-915">collect</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-916"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-917">to</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-918"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-919">make</span><span class="class-0-926" id="id-0-920"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-921">that</span><span class="class-0-920" id="id-0-922"> </span><span class="class-0-818" id="id-0-923">payment and averted her gaze from Trevor to look at them. In her hand, she held the dream she had so longed for and could finally fulfill the promise she made to her mother. She only had one step left, to go up to that man's office and make the exchange. However, that hunch that had assailed her since Reform was prowling the halls intensified. Was it because of the sarcasm he had used in his words? "Disguised swindlers..." Did he know the truth? Or was it all a product of her imagination? What would happen upstairs? Would there be anyone else in that place?</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-936" id="id-0-924">"Don't you want your winnings, Mr. Hernández?" Trevor persisted, turning around.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-937" id="id-0-925">"You promised me," Valeria growled in a low voice.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-938" id="id-0-926">"And I won't break my promise. But if you want it, you just have to accept one condition: accompany me upstairs," he added impassively. "Are you afraid, Mr. Hernández? Are you hiding something I shouldn't discover?" he goaded.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-927">"No, of course not," she declared firmly.</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-813" id="id-0-928">"Then, follow me. The sooner we settle this debt, the sooner you can leave because, if I remember correctly, you were in a hurry," he said, turning towards the door.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-941" id="id-0-929">Valeria observed that tall and burly figure leave the room. Fear, the one Mr. Reform had referred to, had paralyzed her. She couldn't take a single step, nor breathe normally. She clutched the chips in her hand while remembering Kristel and the children. They were waiting for her at home, just as they were waiting for her to fulfill the dreams she talked about so much. The dilemma was growing: go upstairs and get the money or flee from that place, implying that she had deceived the very owner of the club. No, she hadn't cheated in the game, and as for what she was hiding under her clothes, she shouldn't think about it. She was a man, Mr. Hernández, and as such, needed to maintain the attitude of a respectable and honorable gentleman. She put the chips in her left pocket, took a deep breath, and advanced towards that grand figure that had disappeared into the darkness of the foyer.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-943" id="aid_577">VI</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-946" id="id-0-933"><span class="class-0-947" id="id-0-934">She climbed</span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-935"> the stairs located on the right side of the </span><span class="class-0-949" id="id-0-936">hall</span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-937">, just behind the large alabaster pillars that adorned the main entrance. She counted them as she ascended. Twenty in total. Twenty wide and anguishing steps of dark wood that would lead her to the office of the man who would help her fulfill the promise she made to her siblings. When she reached the landing, she couldn't help but look down and, as she had imagined before, she beheld the vastness of the place. In the center, the long and wide foyer welcomed those who entered the gaming rooms. How many gentlemen could be wandering around? Eighty, a hundred? Their well-groomed heads moved like a hundred busy ants.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-938">Valeria looked away from them and fixed her gaze at the end of the hallway. There was the lounge. She never reached that area, but she knew what she would find in the last room. According to what she had heard, gentlemen went to that place to relax while reading, chatting, drinking in front of the warmth of a grand fireplace, or savoring the exquisite dinners that the cook prepared each night. She assumed it was the ideal space to talk business, politics, or perhaps to hide from the world around them. She turned her gaze back to the door she was supposed to enter. An orange light emerged from it. Valeria held her breath when she glimpsed the movement of flames on the shiny, smooth surface. "Go ahead," she encouraged herself. She took a deep breath and positioned herself in front of the entrance to see what was inside.</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="aid_60">The assumptions about what Mr. Reform hid in his office were countless. They even rumored that he had called a blacksmith to forge a cage large enough to put those who dared to steal from him. But that conjecture wasn't true. The interior of the office could be equated to any other, except for its dimensions and the enormous sofa placed on its left. She remained motionless for a few moments, during which he didn't deign to lift his eyes from the papers he was reading, and she meticulously studied every corner of the room. Besides that large sofa, where she imagined he would sleep from time to time, there was a desk that could reach a length of eighty inches. However, it wasn't enough size to accommodate all the papers on it. Valeria could swear that there wasn't even a tiny space left unoccupied.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-953" id="id-0-940"><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-941">When she focused her attention on him, her eyes widened in shock. As illogical as it seemed, Mr. Reform had removed his suit jacket, remaining in that dark vest and pearl-colored shirt, which, to her dismay, he had unbuttoned several buttons, revealing some black chest hair. How could he behave with such audacity? The proper thing was to remain properly dressed when expecting a visitor, but from what she had discovered, that man didn't have an ounce of modesty nor did he understand social protocols.</span><span class="class-0-955" id="id-0-942"> </span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-943"></span></div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="aid_61">Silently, she observed the large armchair in which he was seated. Dark, sober and shiny. Could it be genuine leather? Probably... Two chairs, with curved backs, were positioned in front of him. Of course, to blend in with the surrounding tones, the color was also dark; from where she stood, she couldn't distinguish if they were black or brown. She lowered her gaze to the floor she was about to step on. From the entrance stretched a long, narrow carpet with an intricate design of Turkish warriors mounted on their horses. Valeria concluded that, despite noticing that everything stored there could cost a fortune, Mr. Reform was trying to tone down the ostentation displayed on the lower floor with a simple decor. If that was what he wished to convey, he had succeeded because it struck her as quite a simple room and, due to the comforting warmth of the fireplace, even pleasant.</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-953" id="id-0-945"><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-946">"Do you intend to stand there for the rest</span><span class="class-0-960" id="id-0-947"> </span><span class="class-0-948" id="id-0-948">of the night?

A dragon lying by the fire? Or perhaps that iron cage everyone talked about? A small smile curved his lips, but it disappeared as he remembered that he had to fulfill his promise as soon as possible.</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-950">"I was just admiring what others haven't managed to see," Valeria responded in that tone of voice that was starting to hurt her throat.</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-951">"Well, if you're satisfied now, you can make yourself comfortable in one of those chairs," he indicated, picking up the cut crystal bottle to his left and filling one of the glasses to the brim.</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-951" id="id-0-952">"Do you need me to sit down?
