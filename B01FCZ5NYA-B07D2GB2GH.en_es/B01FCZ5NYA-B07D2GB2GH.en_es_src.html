<body><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Content</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-661">“Anyone been in here since her?” Tracy asked.</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-662">“No. It’s still rented to her.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-663">The manager used the master key to open the door, then stepped aside.</div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-664">“We’ll need you to wait outside,” Tracy said. The woman stepped back.</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="aid_56">Tracy had more than her fair share of experience with motel rooms recently. The Cowboy had killed his victims in cheap motel rooms along the Aurora strip. They could be difficult to process. The latent-fingerprint examiners could find enough prints to start a small village, especially if Lynn Hoff had been a prostitute. When Tracy crossed the threshold she paused, surprised to find the interior so neat and clean. Perhaps too clean.</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-666">“Shot to the back of the head would be messy,” Kins whispered to Tracy, reading her thoughts and keeping his voice low. He moved farther in, looking about. “I doubt she was killed here, but I guess we’ll find out.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-667">An inventory of the refrigerator included a Styrofoam box containing a half-eaten spring roll and leftover pad Thai, but no indication of the restaurant. Tracy also found a half-full pint of 1 percent milk, which, from the smell of it, had soured, a loaf of wheat bread showing the first signs of mold, and a block of cheddar cheese. A half-finished bottle of chardonnay was in the door tray.</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-668">In the bedroom closet, Tracy found a couple of blouses, a jacket, shorts, blue jeans, a pair of tennis shoes, ankle boots, and flip-flops. She moved to the bathroom. On the counter she noted a makeup kit, but with just the bare essentials. The shower was clean, with a small bottle of shampoo and conditioner.</div></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-669">“Sparse,” Kins said, sticking his head into the bathroom.</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-670">“Definitely,” Tracy said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-671">She went back into the kitchen, opening up the cabinet under the sink and pulling out the garbage pail. It had not been emptied. She rummaged through it and found a wadded-up piece of paper—a withdrawal slip from a bank, Emerald Credit Union. The address was also Renton, Washington. “Might have found her bank,” Tracy said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="aid_57">Kins walked over and took a look, then considered the rest of the apartment. “No wallet. No cell phone. No laptop.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-673">“Lynn Hoff did not want someone to find her,” Tracy said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-674">“But someone did,” Kins said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-647" id="id-0-677">Faz and Del rotated their chairs from their desks as Tracy and Kins entered the bull pen. The desks were positioned in the four corners, a worktable in the center. Tracy couldn’t help but compare them to Rex and Sherlock, Dan’s 140-pound Rhodesians, who reacted just as quickly every time Tracy walked in the door. The last time she’d seen the dogs had been early that morning. Dan, a lawyer, had left before her, flying to Los Angeles to argue in court against a motion to set aside a verdict in his client’s favor. Rex hadn’t even bothered to raise his head from his dog bed as Tracy departed the apartment. Only Sherlock had been chivalrous enough to walk Tracy to the door. For that gesture, he’d gotten to enjoy a synthetic dog bone.</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-678">“NCIC and WCIC came up negative for Lynn Hoff,” Faz said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-679">“Seriously?” Kins said, disbelieving. He’d been even more certain that Hoff had been a prostitute after learning she’d been paying cash for her reconstructive surgery and rent at the motel.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-680">“Not even a parking ticket,” Del said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-681">“What about the Department of Licensing?” Tracy asked.</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="aid_58">“More interesting,” Del said. He swiveled his chair and retrieved an 8½ x 11 sheet of paper from his desk, handing it to Tracy. “Meet Lynn Hoff. I’ve asked for a copy of the actual photograph.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-683">Plain looking, Lynn Hoff, if that was her name—Tracy now had doubts—had straight brown hair parted on the side that extended past her shoulders. She wore heavy black-framed glasses. The license indicated she was five foot six and 135 pounds with brown eyes, which corresponded with Funk’s autopsy findings.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-684">“The DOL issued the license March 2016 but has no prior licenses issued in that name,” Del said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-685">“She’s twenty-three,” Tracy said, looking at Kins. “Might not be her real name.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-686">Tracy and Kins had come to that conclusion on the drive back from the motel, after they’d turned jurisdiction of the room over to the CSI sergeant.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-687">“Likely an alias,” Faz said. He swiveled his chair to follow Tracy as she crossed the bull pen to her cubicle and deposited her purse in her locker. “I ran a LexisNexis search on her and came up with bubkes. No past employers, no former addresses. I also ran her name through Social Security. The number appears legit but no employment. She’s a ghost,” Faz said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-688">“A ghost on the run,” Kins said. “She had reconstructive surgery on her face and afterward insisted on getting back all the photographs. She didn’t provide any personal information or family history, and she paid cash for a motel room. It also looks like someone cleaned it. No cell phone. No wallet. No computer or laptops.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-689">Tracy handed Faz a copy of the receipt from the bank she’d found in the garbage. “Found this in the trash, though. Can you log it in and run it down for me?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-690">“No problem,” Faz said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="aid_59">The yellow light on Tracy’s phone blinked, indicating she had a voice mail message—or several dozen. One or two were likely from her favorite muckraker, Maria Vanpelt. Bennett Lee, SPD’s public information officer, had also likely called, in part because Vanpelt had called him. Lee would be seeking a statement for the media. It was unlikely Nolasco had left a message. He liked to be an ass in person.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-692">“How does someone exist today without debit or credit cards?” Del said, facing the interior of the A Team’s shared workspace.</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-693">“Prepaid credit cards and burner cell phones,” Faz said. “You use them and throw them away.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-694">Faz had spent four years working with the fraud unit before homicide. Though he and Del went out of their way to keep things in the section loose, they were far more than just comic relief. Promoted to homicide the same year, twenty-one years ago, they had worked as partners for seventeen and had solved every homicide put before them. Yeah, they played two Italian goombahs, but Faz also had college degrees in accounting and finance, and Del had graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in political science. Over lunch one afternoon, Faz had told Tracy he’d been headed to grad school to get his master’s in tax, but needed to make some money to pay down his student loans. An uncle secured a summer internship for him at the Elizabeth Police Department in New Jersey, and Faz found his calling—much to his mother’s disappointment.</div></td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-695">“But you said you didn’t find any prepaid credit cards or cell phone,” Del said to Tracy and Kins.</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-696">“Didn’t even find a wallet,” Kins said. “She paid cash for the surgery and a month’s rent. Close to seven grand.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-697">“Where’s she getting that kind of money?” Del asked.</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-698">“Don’t know yet.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="aid_60">“Someone could have whacked her and cleaned up the motel room,” Faz said. “They certainly didn’t intend for her body to ever be found.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-700">“Whacked her?” Del said to Kins while jabbing a thumb toward Faz. “He thinks he’s Michael Corleone.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-701">Tracy turned to Kins. “What about running her photograph through facial recognition software, see if we find a license under a different name?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-702">“How’re you going to get the DOL to authorize that?” Kins said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-703">After a $1.6 million investment, SPD had the facial recognition software and staff trained to use it, but the Seattle City Council had only approved its use to go through jail-booking mug shots. The DOL had the most comprehensive database of photographs of Washington residents, but the powers that be would not allow SPD to use that database to hunt down criminals because an ACLU lawyer had argued it could invade John Q. Citizen’s personal privacy rights. Yeah, better to let the criminal kill John Q. Citizen than learn how tall he was, or how overweight. And God forbid they determine the identity of a dead person so they could advise their next of kin.</div></td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-704">“Maybe they’ll make an exception,” Tracy said. “She’s dead.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-705">“A government bureaucrat willing to think outside the box for the greater cause,” Del said. “Good luck with that! While you’re waiting for them to say no, I’ll do things the old-fashioned way and take a look through the missing persons database.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-706">“Let’s at least take the photo back to the condominiums and show it around the marinas,” Tracy said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-707">“We can do that,” Faz said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="aid_61">“CSI is processing the motel room, so there could be another list of names to go through when we get the report from Latents,” Tracy said, growing more frustrated. “Screw this. I’m going to ask Nolasco to push the DOL on the facial recognition. The woman is dead. Whose privacy are we invading?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-709">“Can I get an amen?” Faz said, shaking his hands in the air.</div></td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-710">Del obliged him without looking up.</div></td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-711">“You want me to come with?” Kins asked.</div></td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-712">Tracy only briefly considered his offer. If Nolasco was going to turn her down, it wouldn’t matter if Kins was with her or not. Kins’s offer had more to do with chivalry, like Sherlock walking her to the door in the morning. Tracy and Nolasco’s volatile history dated to the police academy, when she’d stood up for a female recruit during a pat-down demonstration. Nolasco had ended up with a broken nose and singing soprano from a well-placed elbow and knee. More recently, Tracy had inadvertently exposed Nolasco and his former homicide partner, Floyd Hattie, for their somewhat questionable investigation techniques when she discovered one of their cold cases in her search for other possible victims of the Cowboy. That had sparked a full-blown investigation by the Office of Professional Accountability. Hattie, long retired, fell on his sword, and Nolasco, snake that he was, had managed to slither away with only a written reprimand.</div></td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-713">“No,” she said. “If he’s going to turn me down, it won’t matter whether you’re there to see him do it or not.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-714">“Maybe we get lucky and somebody recognizes her,” Kins said. “She had to come from somewhere, right?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>53</td><td><div class="class-0-649" id="id-0-715">“Unless she hatched,” Faz said.</div></td></tr></table></body></html>
