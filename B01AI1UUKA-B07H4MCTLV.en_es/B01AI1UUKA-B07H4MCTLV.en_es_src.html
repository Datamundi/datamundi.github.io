<body><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Content</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><div class="class-0-320" id="id-0-328">Why am I not surprised that he’s a pilot?</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-329">Really, flying was probably one of his tamer activities.</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-330">She busied herself by moving into the kitchen. Micah followed her. He took a seat at the small table after he asked if he could do anything and she refused his help. Working in a kitchen was something that came as naturally to her as breathing. Turning her back on him to make coffee, she wondered what he was thinking. If there was one thing that was still disconcerting about being deaf, it was the isolation she felt when someone was in the same room unless she was looking at that person directly. As she worked, Tessa realized that the silence wasn’t uncomfortable. In a way, she could <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-331">sense</span> Micah’s presence, and she didn’t feel alone even though she couldn’t see him. It was an unusual sensation, and one she really hadn’t experienced since she’d lost her hearing.</div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-332">Focusing on the task at hand, she had breakfast ready quickly. She didn’t notice what Micah was occupying his time with until she had put their coffee and plates on the table.</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-333">“That’s private,” she growled, snatching a piece of paper from his fingers. “Do you always read other people’s mail?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-334">He looked up at her. “Only when it has the logo of my charity on the correspondence. Technically, it’s my mail, too.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-335">It didn’t take her long to bury the letter in a kitchen drawer and slam it closed. She should have tossed the silly offer a week ago. The missive <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-336">did</span> have the Sinclair Fund’s name on the letterhead, but she was still ticked that he had picked it up and was in the process of reading it when she’d taken it away from him.</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="aid_29">“It’s addressed to me,” she told him defensively, folding her arms across her chest.</div></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-338">“I should have recognized you,” he said, eyeing Tessa curiously now. “You’re Theresa Sullivan. I could never place your face, but I knew I’d seen you before. I’ve seen you skate.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-339">It was no surprise that he hadn’t known where he’d seen her previously. Almost nobody connected her previous life with the one she lived now. The Olympic gold medalist in figure skating from almost a decade ago was long gone. Who would know her now? The disabled deaf woman who helped run a broken-down restaurant in a small coastal town was very different from the eighteen-year-old young woman who’d once shined as a rising star. There was no fancy costume, no heavy makeup, and her hair was a tangled mess that she rarely bothered to try to contain in any sense of style anymore. She looked nothing like she had when she was skating competitively.</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-340">Tessa turned her back to him again, nervously fiddling with cutlery and napkins before setting them on the table.</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-341">“I’m not that woman anymore,” she finally replied, seating herself across from him.</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-342">“Of course you are. You’re still Theresa Sullivan, right?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-343">“Tessa,” she told him tersely. “Everyone I know has always called me Tessa.” Legally, her name <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-344">was</span> Theresa, but she’d only used it in competition and on legal documents.</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-345">“Okay, Tessa,” he answered, still staring at her with a calculating look that almost scared her. Micah was no fool, and she knew he could sense her anger and frustration. “Are you going to do it?” He locked eyes with her for a moment, his expression curious.</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-346">Was he joking? “I can’t. I’m deaf. I haven’t skated since I lost my hearing.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="aid_30">The letter requesting her to perform in a reunion of past Olympic medalists had saddened her. She’d never be able to be the same woman she’d been ten years ago. Honestly, she wasn’t certain how the Fund’s committee had even learned of her whereabouts. Liam had shielded her, made sure to keep her out of the media. Outside of her circle of friends and some of the townspeople, nobody knew she’d once been one of the most accomplished figure skaters in the world. The small town of Amesport had kept her secret. It had grown over the last ten years, but the original residents had stayed silent, respected the fact that she was healing. Once she’d recovered, Rick had dumped her, and she’d come back home for good, her accident had been old news, and it really hadn’t mattered anymore.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-348">Micah shrugged as he took a slug of coffee and then dug into his eggs, bacon, and toast. “You could still do it.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-349">She picked up her mug, but froze as she read his response. “I can’t perform. I haven’t skated in years, and I can’t even hear the music. The Sinclair Fund obviously doesn’t realize that I can’t hear.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-350">One other problem was that the event was taking place in New York City. Tessa was comfortable right here in Amesport. She didn’t want to travel to New York.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-351">Chewing on his toast, he stared at her for a long time before answering, “I didn’t think you were the type of woman to give up easily.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-352">He was calling her a quitter, and that pissed her off. “I’m retired from the sport. I had no choice. Deaf people don’t do skating performances.” She took a sip of her coffee, irritated that he was making it sound like she had any other option than to give up her skating career.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-353">“The Fund is offering a very lucrative deal, and it’s for a good cause.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-354">Tessa felt tears of disappointment spring into her eyes, but she blinked them away as she sipped her coffee and then set the mug back on the table. It wasn’t like she didn’t <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-355">want</span> to do the appearance; it wasn’t possible. They were offering good payment that she could desperately use, and all profits from the event were going to a children’s charity that she really wanted to support.</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-356">A single tear escaped as she picked up her fork and attacked her eggs. Eating slowly, she avoided looking at his face.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="aid_31">She couldn’t do it . . . period! Tessa didn’t want to look at Micah and see his disappointed expression. It was clear to her that he really <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-358">did</span> think she could simply hit the ice and skate again. Maybe <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-359">he</span> had confidence in her, but she had none in herself when it came to doing the impossible. And she was almost angry at him for making it seem like performing again would be no big deal.</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-360">Maybe <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-361">he</span> could do anything, and thought nothing of risking his life by jumping from places that weren’t made to be launch sites.</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-362">Maybe <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-363">he</span> was cocky enough to think that he was invincible.</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-364">She . . . wasn’t.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-365">The last thing she needed was to feel like a failure . . . again. Not when she was only now regaining control of her life.</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-366">Most of the time, she could forget who she’d been before she’d lost her hearing, but that stupid offer from the Sinclair Fund had temporarily brought it all rushing back with a vengeance. After her hearing loss, she’d put aside all thoughts of skating again. What was the point? It was a career path that she could never follow, and forgetting had been the sensible thing to do back then. She’d lost her fiancé over her handicap, and she’d taken a lot of emotional blows since she’d left Boston and the man she’d once worshipped.</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-367">After Tessa’s father had passed away, her mother had needed help in the restaurant. When her mom had gotten sick, soon after her dad’s death, and then died only a year later, Tessa had been thrust into the role of restaurant owner quickly. Liam had come home for good, giving up a well-loved, lucrative career to be here in Amesport with her. Back then, she’d needed her brother, had clung to him like a lifeline. Now, he was “helping her” until he drove her nearly insane.</div></td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td><div class="class-0-320" id="id-0-368">It’s time to move on. I’m finally content with my life now. I can’t go back. I don’t want to go back.</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="aid_32">Finally, she answered, “You don’t understand. You have no idea what it’s like to suddenly lose everything you’ve ever known, everything you care about.” She’d been incredibly isolated, suddenly handicapped, and unable to do the thing she’d loved most in the world.</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-370">She’d had so many losses over the course of five or six years that she hadn’t been able to take another blow. She’d never had time to recover. Losing her hearing, her fiancé, her skating career, her father, and then finally her mom, all in a relatively short period of time, had nearly killed her.</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-371">Over time, she’d learned to function in a world with no sound. She was finally at peace with her condition. The last thing she needed was to reopen old wounds. She’d come too far to slide backward now.</div></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-372">There wasn’t really a deaf community in her area, and she’d already had friends, so it had just been a matter of learning to connect with them again. The need to be able to communicate and not feel so isolated had been almost an obsession. She’d learned to read lips as quickly as possible when she was with Rick, and she’d become an expert at it from years of practice. ASL was easier, but other than Liam, her parents, and her best friend, Randi, nobody knew sign language. Becoming very, very good at lip reading had been her only option. And she <span class="class-0-322" id="id-0-373">was</span> good at it, so good that some people didn’t even notice she was deaf if she was having a face-to-face conversation with them.</div></td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-374">Liam had told her that her speaking voice sounded almost identical to her pre-deafness voice. Her friends had claimed the same thing. But Tessa would never really know if they were pacifying her, or if what they said was the truth. It wasn’t that she didn’t trust them, but all of them had kind hearts, and what person who cared about her was going to tell a deaf woman that she talked strangely?</div></td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-375">Slowly, she’d lost touch with most of her old friends in the area, feeling different from all of her former friends. It hurt to be different, but she’d learned to live with the distance between herself and old friends; most of them were still acquaintances, and they were kind to her.</div></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="aid_33">Tessa startled as she felt the warmth of Micah’s large, strong hand cradling hers. Her eyes flew to his face.</div></td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-377">“I’ll help you, Tessa.” The look on his face was intense as he spoke. “You don’t have to do it alone.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td><div class="class-0-319" id="id-0-378">“I can’t do it at all,” she mumbled, unable to pull her hand from his. That simple contact warmed her, and the need for human connection was gnawing at her soul.</div></td></tr></table></body></html>
