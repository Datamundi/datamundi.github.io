<body><table><tr><th>Number</th><th>Content</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-362">Luca didn’t come to see me. Not on the day my grandfather announced that we’ll be getting married, and not any time during the following weeks. I guess he considered it not necessary since we already knew each other.</div></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-363">I assess my reflection again, noting the long, white, lacy dress and expensive tiara on top of my head. My dream is finally coming true. But, I never thought it would be such a bitter experience. Based on what I overheard the morning I eavesdropped outside of my grandfather’s study, I should have expected it.</div></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-364"><span class="class-0-377" id="id-0-365">“</span><span class="class-0-378" id="id-0-366">What am I going to do with a nineteen-year-old,” </span><span class="class-0-377" id="id-0-367">Luca said. As if I was a stray dog someone brought in off the street. One he couldn’t throw out, but he didn’t want there either.</span></div></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-368">I’m glad I only overheard the tail end of the conversation. God knows what else he said before that.</div></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="aid_36">There is a knock on the door and my father’s head peeks inside. “You’re beautiful, Isa.” He smiles and turns to my mother. “Emma, we need to hurry or we’re going to be late.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-370">“We’ll be down in a minute,” she says, moving somewhere behind me.</div></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-371">The staff leave the room first, my mother following, then Andrea and I exit last.</div></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-372">“Smile, Isa! You’re finally marrying Luca,” she whispers. “It still feels surreal.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-373">“Yeah.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-374">“Oh, come on. It’s your wedding day for God’s sake. I expected you to be ecstatic. People will expect you to be happy.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-375">“I’m just nervous,” I lie. I haven’t told her about what I heard Luca say in Grandfather’s study. “Here, better?” I ask and offer one of my favorite fake smiles.</div></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-376">“Perfect. I love that one, I’ve never really managed to pull off the right mix of happiness with a tiny bit of shyness. You were always Mom’s best student.” She laughs.</div></td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td><div class="class-0-389" id="id-0-377">Yes, it’s all about appearances in our world.</div></td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td><div class="class-0-392" id="id-0-380">My divorce is official as of yesterday afternoon. And now, not even twenty-four hours later, I’m standing in front of an altar, waiting for my new bride. Unbelievable.</div></td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="aid_37">The church’s tall door opens, and Isabella, on her father’s arm, steps inside. I take the opportunity to study my future wife as she approaches. Maybe it’s the light, but her face looks different from the last time I saw her for more than a fleeting second. She’s still breathtaking. Still the same long hair, huge eyes, and sharp cheekbones. I can’t pinpoint exactly what it is, but there’s something amiss. She gives the impression that she’s happy. A small smile is on her lips, and her head is held high—a picture-perfect image of a radiant bride. I move my gaze back to her eyes, and that’s when I see it. Her face might be showing happiness and joy, but the emotion doesn’t reach her eyes. Instead, they seem . . . empty.</div></td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-382">She takes the final step to stand beside me, her gaze focused solely on the priest. Of course, she doesn’t want this either. What nineteen-year-old would want to be tied to a man almost twice her age? She must be scared about what’s happening. I should have gone to speak with her beforehand, met her properly prior to the wedding. It’s not as if I’m planning on us having a marriage that fits the true sense of the word, but still.</div></td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-383">As the priest starts speaking, I reach out to take her hand in mine, and hear her sharp intake of breath. Isabella looks down at our joined hands, then lifts her gaze to stare right at me. Her eyes are not vacant anymore, and as she watches me, I can almost see the fire burning in their dark depths. I like that much better than the dead look.</div></td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-384">After the priest finishes and we exchange rings, I lean down and place a quick kiss on her cheek. When I straighten and look at her, I find her watching me with that empty stare again.</div></td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td><div class="class-0-397" id="id-0-385">* * *</div></td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td><div class="class-0-367" id="aid_38">I lift my glass and sip the seltzer without taking my eyes off the corner of the room where my young wife is standing with her sister and mother.</div></td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-387">The moment we arrived at the country club, where the wedding lunch is being held, Isabella left my side and went to the opposite end of the room. She hasn’t looked in my direction once. I should be relieved. Instead, I’ve been watching her for more than an hour, noticing every man who gives her a passing glance. It pisses me off. Not only the looks other men are giving her, but also the fact that it’s bothering me.</div></td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-388">“What an unexpected turn of events,” Lorenzo Barbini says as he steps up next to me.</div></td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-389">“Oh?” I take another sip of my drink. “Do you mean the wedding or the fact that Giuseppe named me his successor?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-390">“Both, to be honest. I thought the plan was to have Angelo Scardoni marry his granddaughter.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-391">“Plans change,” I say.</div></td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-392">Lorenzo has been Giuseppe’s underboss for almost fifteen years, which is longer than I’ve been a capo. It’s understandable that he was surprised by the don’s decision. Everyone was, including me. Usually, when a don dies or decides to step down, it’s his son or son-in-law who takes over the leadership. If that’s not the case, then the reigns are passed to the underboss. My new grandfather-in-law chose to forge a new path.</div></td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-393">“Are you sure you can handle everything your new position will entail?” he asks.</div></td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="aid_39">I’ve never aspired to lead the Family. Making arms deals, managing transactions so everything runs smoothly, and bringing in money was my main focus. Presently, the operations I oversee account for more than 50 percent of our earnings.</div></td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-395">“Do you think you’d make a better don?” I ask.</div></td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-396">“Let’s be real here, Luca. You’re a businessman and you do a great job. But you rarely attend Family events, and I’m pretty sure you have no idea how to handle internal affairs.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-397">He’s right. I don’t give a damn about their dinners, or who banged whose wife. Assuming the head position of the Chicago Cosa Nostra means resolving a bunch of private matters, meddling in debt issues between high-level members, and arranging marriages within the Family. Other people’s personal drama is not something I enjoy. But how little I care about the social aspect of the job doesn’t mean I’ll allow anyone to question my abilities.</div></td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-398">“Yes, I assume you’d be better versed in handling that part, considering that sitting at parties is all you’ve been doing recently. Tell me, Lorenzo, would you run the Family the same way you’re running our casinos? Because from what I know, you’ve been dealing with significant losses for months.” I smile, enjoying the shock that spreads over his face. “Losses, might I add, that were covered with the profits I brought in from the gun deals. Maybe you should focus on taking care of your own shit before you aspire to take on more responsibilities?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-399">“He who flies high, falls deep,” Lorenzo mumbles into his glass.</div></td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-400">I smile and grab the knot of his tie, pulling him up slightly. “I didn’t hear you well.” I bend, getting into his face, “Can you please repeat that?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="aid_40">Lorenzo’s nostrils flare as the redness starts spreading over his face. He stares at me with bulging eyes for a few moments, then grits his teeth.</div></td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-402">“I said, your information is wrong,” he sneers, “There is nothing wrong with the casino business.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-403">“Oh. My bad, then.” I release his tie and nod toward the corner of the room. “Seems like your wife is looking for you.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-404">Lorenzo gives me one angry stare, then marches away, and I turn my eyes back to my young wife. Franco Conti, the capo in charge of laundering money, is speaking with Emma, Isabella’s mother. I haven’t collaborated with Franco much, since he only handles money that comes from our casinos. Damian is in charge of laundering what my operations make, and I plan on keeping it that way. Standing next to Franco is Dario D’Angelo, the oldest son of Capo Santino D’Angelo, who is talking with Isabella. She smiles at something he says, then turns toward her sister, and I notice the way Dario’s gaze passes down her body while she’s not looking. Grinding my teeth, I pivot around and head to the bar. Who she talks to shouldn’t concern me. I’m halfway to my destination when I hear female laughter ring out behind me, so I peer over my shoulder. Isabella and her sister are giggling at something Dario has just said.</div></td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-405">It shouldn't bother me that another man can make her laugh. But it does. It’s like a damn itch in my side. I ignore the urge to walk over and shoo Santino’s son away from Isabella. Instead, I join Orlando Lombardi, another capo who handles the Family’s gambling business, at the bar.</div></td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-406">“Did you hear about last week’s shitstorm in New York?” he asks when I take a seat next to him.</div></td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="aid_41">“I’m not into gossip.” I motion for the barman to bring me another seltzer. “Too much shit to deal with here.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-408">“Ajello annihilated two Camorra clans in one night. Forty-seven people. Looks like they tried sticking their fingers in his business.” Orlando leans close to me. “One of my nieces is married to a guy who works as a foot soldier for Ajello. She heard Ajello was shot during the skirmish.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-409">I take a sip of my drink. What the don of New York does doesn’t concern me in the least, I have no business with him. But I can’t say I’m not a bit curious. That man has always been a mystery. “Is he dead?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-410">“No. But that’s all I know,” Orlando says. “His ranks are too tightly stitched, and his men are loyal to a point of madness. My niece only overheard the conversation when her husband talked over the phone with someone.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-411">I’m trying my best to keep my eyes focused on my drink, but can’t fight the compulsion to take another look at Isabella. When I do, I find her watching me. The moment our gazes connect, however, she turns back to Dario.</div></td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-412">“You know, I sometimes think that man doesn’t exist,” Orlando continues. “How come no one has ever met him?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-413">“Giuseppe did,” I say and glance at my wife again. She’s still talking with the idiot. “Last year.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-414">“No! Why did he never mention it?”</div></td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-415">“Because Giuseppe doesn’t need to share what he does with anyone.”</div></td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td><div class="class-0-368" id="id-0-416">“He told you,” he says with an envious glint in his eyes. “What was the meeting about?”</div></td></tr></table></body></html>
